# SnapSens - Live Face Detection

## Introduction
The SnapSens project aims to develop a live face detection system using Python and a personalized dataset of faces. Face detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as facial recognition systems, surveillance, biometrics, and emotion analysis. By building a face detection AI system from scratch, the project aims to gain a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms and techniques in artificial intelligence and computer vision.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the challenge of developing an accurate and robust face detection system. The main difficulties in face detection include capturing diverse face variations, optimizing performance under occlusion and varying lighting conditions, and implementing complex algorithms. By overcoming these challenges, the project aims to contribute to the field of computer vision and enhance knowledge in artificial intelligence.

## Achievements
We have successfully implemented the VGGG-16 model, but we have modified it to work for our dataset with  specific shape and size of image and not on the images from the ImageNet dataset on which VGG-16 model is trained. We have wrote the code fully connected layers (also known as the "top") of the VGG16 model will not be included. 

## Methodology
The project utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture for face detection. VGG16 is a widely used architecture known for its strong performance in image classification tasks. However, for personalized shapes, the first convolutional layer of VGG16 is removed to tailor the model to the specific face detection task.

## Dataset
The project uses a personalized dataset of faces for training and testing the face detection model. The dataset contains variations in lighting conditions, poses, expressions, and backgrounds. Preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and noise reduction are applied to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset.

## Training Process
The training process involves training the face detection model using the personalized dataset. A specific loss function and optimization algorithm are selected for this task. Hyperparameters are tuned, and the training time and computational resources utilized are recorded.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the face detection system.

## Results and Analysis
 * We have plots the training and validation loss values for three different categories: total loss, classification loss, and regression loss. It visualizes the performance of a model during training and helps in understanding the learning process.
